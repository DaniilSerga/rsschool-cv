### About me
A junior frontend developer specializing in the use of advanced technologies to create easy-to-maintain and outstanding digital products. <br/>

Completely dedicated to information technologies. I have a number of hobbies that I intensively develop. For example, I was part of a vocal group, a guitarist of a student music band, learned to write my own arrangements, tried myself in the profession of a sound engineer. I like to study foreign languages (currently I am learning a polish language). I have participated in various competitions in English at school and university. I attend all IT-related events. <br/>

My soft skills are that I'm sociable, stress-resistant, highly adaptable to ever changing circumstances. I easily join a new team and find new friends and have no stage fear. <br/>

At the moment I am studying at Polessky State University, majoring in information systems and technologies and I'm getting an internship at YOUX Systems company. Also I had an experience working as a Backend developer at PolessUP laboratory. <br/>

My plans are to get as maximum technical skills in the field of digital product development as possible <br/>

I strive to become a person who can change other people's lives for the better by creating cool things.

### Code example:

***5KYU | RGB To Hex Conversion (Codewars Task)*** <br/>
*The rgb function is incomplete. Complete it so that passing in RGB decimal values will result in a hexadecimal representation being returned. Valid decimal values for RGB are 0 - 255. Any values that fall out of that range must be rounded to the closest valid value.*

``` JavaScript
function rgb(r, g, b) {
  return [r, g, b].map((value) => {
    value = value < 0 ? 0 : value;
    value = value > 255 ? 255 : value;
    value = value.toString(16).toUpperCase();
    return value.length == 1 ? '0' + value : value;
  }).join('');  
}
```
